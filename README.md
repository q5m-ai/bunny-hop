# Hop for the Prize!

A polished, mobile-first recruitment website for The Gatekeeper's friendly, voluntary bunny-hopping market activity. It is a dependency-free static site with an original SVG illustration, welfare-first guidance, accessible controls, a privacy-respecting email interest form, and an on-demand Gatekeeper video reference.

## Files

- `index.html` — semantic one-page site and all copy
- `styles.css` — responsive design, accessible focus states, and reduced-motion support
- `event-config.js` — **the single place to edit event details**
- `script.js` — event display, Gatekeeper dialog, and local `mailto:` form preparation
- `favicon.svg`, `social-card.svg` — original local artwork
- The friendly cartoon Gatekeeper is an original inline SVG in `index.html`; the real Gatekeeper appears only after the video is opened
- `404.html` — custom not-found page
- `server.py` — LAN-only static HTTP server with security headers

## Edit event details

Open `event-config.js` and replace the empty strings in `window.HOP_EVENT`. Leave unknown values empty. Once `contactEmail` contains a valid address, the form enables itself and opens the visitor's email client with a prefilled message. The site itself never stores or transmits form data.

## Run locally

```bash
cd /Users/erik/code/bunny-hopppers
python3 server.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8780
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8780/`.

## LAN publishing

The site is published as the PM2 process `q5m-bunny-hop`, bound only to the host's LAN address (`10.1.1.211`) on port `8780`. PM2's existing launchd integration restores saved processes after login/reboot without modifying other q5m services.

- LAN URL: `http://q5m-dev.localdomain:8780/`
- Direct fallback: `http://10.1.1.211:8780/`

Restart or stop:

```bash
pm2 restart q5m-bunny-hop
pm2 stop q5m-bunny-hop
```

After starting or deleting PM2 processes, run `pm2 save` to update reboot persistence.

Status and logs:

```bash
pm2 status q5m-bunny-hop
pm2 logs q5m-bunny-hop --lines 100
```

## Production

The public site is deployed as the hardened, stateless `bunny-hop` application on `q5m-n01`. Its exact Git release is activated and health-gated by `q5m-app`; public traffic enters through Cloudflare Tunnel at `https://bunny-hop.q5m.ai/`.
